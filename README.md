    2. If the entered verification code is invalid, the user is prompted to try again and a fresh verification code is sent to the user's phone number

## What next?
Nexmopress is a demonstrator of how powerful the Nexmo platform capabilities are and how it can be integrated to enhance Wordpress to make it more secure. Of course, in it's current form, Nexmopress is just the tip of the iceberg and it can be expanded further to generate more powerful analytics for Wordpress users based on the wealth of information provided by Nexmo API.

I had a lot of fun building Nexmopress for the Nexmo Developer Contest and I hope you've as much fun evaluating it. May the best app win!
